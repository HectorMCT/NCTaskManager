/**
 * Task is a base class for all basic tasks which allow to the
 * user create simple tasks according his necessities.
 *
 * A Task object encapsulate the state information related to when
 * the task it is going to occur, and it states.
 * This state information includes:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The title of the task
 * <li>The time of starting.
 * <li>The time of finishing.
 * <li>The interval of time when the task it is going to occur.
 * <li>The current state that indicate if it is an active task or not.
 * <li>The current state that indicate if the task it is repetitive
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Tasks can be of two types:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Normal Task
 *     <li>Repetitive Task
 * </ul>
 * The normal task can only happen once.
 * Meanwhile, Repetitive Task can happen many times according to it is
 * interval of time, and it is time of finish.
 * At the moment of create each new object Task it is created as an
 * inactive task.
